* Login, company & user management

- A user can signup and create a company at the same time. The user is
  identified by the email address which cannot be changed.

- A user can invite other users by email. When the new user signs up
  with the invitation, she is identified with the invitation recipient
  email address, and is a member of the same company as the inviter.

- A user cannot change company.

- The company is identified by a label, which has to be unique.

* Product, stock & storage

- A product is identified by a gtin and a label, and is bound to a
  company.

- A product is unique by gtin and company.

- A product has three different kinds of stock per storage:
  + Physical: The quantity in storage
  + Sold: The quantity bound to orders that are paid
  + Reserved: The quantity bound to orders that are not paid
  + ATP: Available to purchase; Physical - (Sold + Reserved)

- A product can be marked as 'virtual'. In this case, the physical
  value is always one, and sold and reserved are always zero. This
  value can be set for things like gift packaging or personalized
  cards.

- The only stock that can be changed for a product is that of
  physical. The rest is changed based on the status of the orders
  containing that product as item, and ATP as an aggregate of the
  rest. Changing stock happens only based on deltas; it is not
  possible to set absolute value for stock.

* Orders

- An order consists of an address, a list of order items, routing
  status and payment status. Payment status can be one of processing,
  captured, or rejected.

- An order item consists of a reference to a product and quantity.

- When an order is created, it is routed to one of the storage
  locations. The stock value of the item that is routed then depends
  on the payment status of the order. If it is processing, the items
  are only reserved. If it is captured, they are sold.

- An order item can be cancelled before it is shipped.

* Routing & shipments

- When an order is routed to a storage location, a logistic order is
  created.

- A logistic order item consists of a list of logistic order items and
  shipment status.
